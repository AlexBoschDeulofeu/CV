# CV — Àlex Bosch
1) User Persona

My name is Àlex Bosch. I am a student from Sant Feliu de Guíxols.  
I am a hard-working person who likes to learn new things and work in a team.  
I made this website to show my CV online in a simple and modern way.  
It helps me present myself better when I apply for jobs or internships.  
The main goal is to show who I am, what experience I have, and how to contact me.  
The CV is also easy to read for people from companies or anyone who wants to know more about me.

2) Information Architecture
The website is only one page. At the top, there is my photo with a color background, so people can recognize me fast.  
Under that, you can see my name and my role as a student. Then there is a short text that explains a bit about me.  
The page is divided into two columns. On the left side there is the most important information: my work experience and my studies.  
Each section has a title and short texts that explain where and when I worked or studied.  
On the right side there are my skills, the languages I speak, and my contact information.  
This helps people find what they need quickly.  
When the page is smaller (like on a phone), the two columns become one, so it is easy to read.  
Everything is organized in a clean and simple way so users can focus on the information.

3) Visual Design
The design is clean and minimal. I used purple and violet colors because they look nice and modern.  
The background on top has a gradient with different tones of purple. It gives personality to the page but still keeps the text easy to read.  
The rest of the page is white, so the content has good contrast.  
The font is the normal system font, like Segoe UI or Roboto, because it is easy to read and looks good on all devices.  
The photo is round and has a white border to make it look professional.  
I used rounded corners and soft shadows on the main card so it looks friendly.  
The text is big enough, and there is space between the elements, so everything is clear.  
On a mobile phone, the page adapts and everything is centered.  
I wanted the final result to look simple, clean, and a bit creative, like me.
